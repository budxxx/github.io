ADDITIONAL CONTEXT AND USAGE GUIDELINES
The text above constitutes the official legal license for this project. To provide clarity and context for users, recruiters, and fellow developers who may wish to utilize this Web CV repository, the following points elaborate on the permissions, implications, and distinctions regarding the content herein.
DISTINCTION BETWEEN CODE AND PERSONAL CONTENT
While this project is open-source under the MIT License, a crucial distinction must be made between the "Software" (the HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript logic, and build configurations) and the "Content" (personal biography, work history, phone numbers, email addresses, and photographs).
You are explicitly encouraged to copy the code structure to build your own CV.
You should NOT copy the personal data, work history, or identity represented in the text content. Using the author's personal details as your own may constitute identity fraud and is not covered by the spirit of this open-source grant.
FREEDOM TO MODIFY AND ADAPT
The permission to "deal in the Software without restriction" means you have complete creative control over any fork you create.
You may completely overhaul the color scheme (e.g., changing Tailwind configuration).
You may strip out the JavaScript animations if you prefer a static site.
You may convert this static HTML site into a React, Vue, or Angular application.
You may use this template for commercial purposes, such as building a portfolio site for a paying client, without owing royalties to the original author.
ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS
The condition that "The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included" implies that you must retain the license file in your version of the project. However, you are not required to display the original author's name on the visible frontend of your website. The attribution is primarily intended for the source code level to acknowledge the origin of the template structure.
LIABILITY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER ("AS IS")
The section stating the software is provided "AS IS" is a comprehensive disclaimer of liability.
Technical Usage: The author guarantees no specific uptime, browser compatibility beyond what is currently implemented, or fitness for a particular hosting environment.
Professional Outcome: The author accepts no responsibility for the professional outcomes resulting from the use of this CV template. Using this template does not guarantee job interviews, employment offers, or professional success.
Data Security: While the code is written to be safe, the author is not liable for any security vulnerabilities that may arise from your specific deployment or modification of the code.
By using this repository, you acknowledge understanding these distinctions. The goal of this open-source release is to help others showcase their careers, not to provide a false identity or assume liability for third-party usage.
